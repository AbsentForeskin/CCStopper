# FAQ

<details>
<summary>Q: It asks for administrator permissions????</summary>
<br>
A: This script needs those permissions to stop Adobe from running in the background and to delete the AdobeGCClient folder. You should be weary of all software/scripts that ask for administrator permissions (especially Github scripts like this one). Please don't run this script if you don't know what you're doing. The full source code of this script is available in this repository.</details>
